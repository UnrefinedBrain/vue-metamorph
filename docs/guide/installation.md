# Installation

There are two ways to use vue-metamorph - you can use it directly within your own app or library via its exports, or use the scaffolding tool to quickly create a vue-metamorph CLI project.

To scaffold a vue-metamorph project:

```bash
$ npx vue-metamorph my-codemod-name
```

vue-metamorph's scaffold script will create a new directory at `my-codemod-name` containing a sample codemod project.

To install vue-metamorph in your existing package:

```bash
# npm
$ npm install -D vue-metamorph

# yarn
$ yarn add -D vue-metamorph

# pnpm
$ pnpm i -D vue-metamorph
```
